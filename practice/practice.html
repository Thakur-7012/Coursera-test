        Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish.
